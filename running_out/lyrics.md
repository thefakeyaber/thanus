# Lyrics to Running Out

## Verse 1:
Pacing down the path  
The lives that we've had  
The fights that made us who we are  
Behind a locked door

Piercing with your gaze  
Fading into haze  
A shadow that cries out loud  
Trapped, in the light of the foul

## Chorus:
I'm running out of places to run to  
The mask is falling off  
Shaking hands with the void inside  
When I should've been holding yours

## Verse 2:
Living with a sold out soul  
Faith dancing on pole  
Flirting with the devil  
After all

Staring at a screen all day  
Trying to find the end of feed  
Hopes are gathering dust  
As the night gazes along

## Chorus:
I'm running out of places to run to  
The mask is falling off  
Shaking hands with the void inside  
When I should've been holding yours
