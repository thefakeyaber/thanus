        <h1>Lyrics to <span class="song-title">Running Out</span></h1>
        
        <h2>Verse 1:</h2>
        <p>Pacing down the path<br>
        The lives that we've had<br>
        The fights that made us who we are<br>
        Behind a locked door</p>

        <p>Piercing with your gaze<br>
        Fading into haze<br>
        A shadow that cries out loud<br>
        Trapped, in the light of the foul</p>

        <h2>Chorus:</h2>
        <p>I'm running out of places to run to<br>
        The mask is falling off<br>
        Shaking hands with the void inside<br>
        When I should've been holding yours</p>

        <h2>Verse 2:</h2>
        <p>Living with a sold out soul<br>
        Faith dancing on pole<br>
        Flirting with the devil<br>
        After all</p>

        <p>Staring at a screen all day<br>
        Trying to find the end of feed<br>
        Hopes are gathering dust<br>
        As the night gazes along</p>

        <h2>Chorus:</h2>
        <p>I'm running out of places to run to<br>
        The mask is falling off<br>
        Shaking hands with the void inside<br>
        When I should've been holding yours</p>
